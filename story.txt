Start your story with a paragraph that introduces a character and setting:

Shaokang Jiang: A rabbit Kim likes to eat carrot. He is always playing while eating. But he is too lazy to collect food. Then he runs out of his storage in the middle-winter. He feels sad and doesn't know what to do next ...  

As Kim wanders around the forest in search of food, he happens upon a bird. He asks the bird, "Hello fair bird. I've run out of all my food! It is the middle of winter and I am starving! Could you spare me any food?" The bird replies, "I'm sorry rabbit, but I have no food to spare. Worms are few and far between and I have a hard time making ends meet for my family as it is. However, I do know someone who may be able to help you. I saw a squirrel heading east not too long ago. He was carrying a plethora of food with him! Perhaps you could search for him and ask for some of what he had." After thanking the bird, Kim wandered off in search of this squirrel...
